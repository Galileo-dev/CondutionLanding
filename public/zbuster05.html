        Hey there! I don't know how or why you have stumbled across this route, but you have. I'm glad to be honest. It's not often I get to communicate to our users in such a random way. Of course I'm assuming you're a user. If I'm wrong it isn't too late to use the app. I've personally found it very useful and this isn't just me trying to market it to you. If you want you should join our discord too!

    Anways, here it isn't my concern whether or not you're using our app, or whether or not you're on the Discord. Here is simply a place that I can communicate to you. Whoever you are. So, I have a present for you. Like most people on the internet you probably like clicking buttons and typing. So here, I'll give you a free unstyled button and input field that do nothing to use.
